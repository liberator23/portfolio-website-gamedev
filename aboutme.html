        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm a dual Canadian-German citizen and Game Designer pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment. I hold a BSc in Communication and Multimedia Design from Hanze University of Applied Sciences, with a major in Game Design and a minor in Medialism. My graduation assignment "Polder" was nominated for the best student project of 2023 at Hanze UAS. I specialise in technical, systems, and level design.</p>
        <p>As an analytical and pragmatic creative with strong communication and problem solving skills, I enjoy the unique challenges presented by the game design and development processes. I've worked both as an indie developer and with international multidisciplinary teams to deliver outstanding games and digital experiences. I am also a fully certified and endorsed Red Seal Journeyman Electrician.</p>
        <p>When it comes to playing games, I am a fan of RPGs, action-adventures, tactical first-person shooters, survival-crafters, and co-operative focused multiplayer games to name a few. I love learning about the inner workings of game systems and mechanics while I play and explore them! I'm the kind of person that will happily spend over an hour in a character creator obsessing over all of the minuscule details.</p>
        <p>When I'm not creating new games and experiences, I enjoy going bouldering, playing airsoft, camping, going snowboarding, travelling, and of course playing video games!</p>

        <h3 class="w3-text-cyan">Early Life</h3>
        <h4>1995 - 2011</h4>
        <p>Born in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, early life was rife with cold winters and short summers. As a child I was first introduced to video games from my father and sisters playing games like Mario Party and GoldenEye 007 on the Nintendo 64. At around the age of seven my father gave me my first game console, the PlayStation 2, fully cementing my love for the medium. I continued to enjoy video games from many genres and gaming consoles over the following years and developed a strong passion for them. For around five years I lived in various parts of the Bay Area of California, exposing me to many new cultures and facets of life.

        <h3 class="w3-text-cyan">First Career</h3>
        <h4>2012 - 2017</h4>
        <p>I graduated highschool with a focus on art, theatre production, and multimedia design as well as several Imperial Oil awards in mathematics. I became an Electrician focused in commercial construction and pursued an apprenticeship for four and a half years, eventually becoming a fully licensed and endorsed Red Seal Journeyman Electrician.</p>

        <h3 class="w3-text-cyan">Reflection</h3>
        <h4>2018</h4>
        <p>I began to think about what I really wanted to do going forward in my life, and what things had inspired me the most in my journey so far. I realised that I loved games and the experiences they convey more than being an Electrician, and that I had experiences and stories of my own to tell. After a trip to Europe, I was inspired to obtain my dual Canadian - German citizenship and began to search for universities with Game Design programs across Canada and Europe.</p>

        <h3 class="w3-text-cyan">An Oversea Odyssey</h3>
        <h4>2019 - 2021</h4>
        <p>I made the decision to move away from Canada across the globe to The Netherlands and begin my education in game design at Hanze University of Applied Sciences, inspired and motivated to pursue my dream to become a Game Designer. Having been only the second time that I lived outside of Canada, I was exposed to significantly more cultures and sources of inspiration in my life.</p>

        <h3 class="w3-text-cyan">Building Skills</h3>
        <h4>2022 - 2023</h4>
        <p>I successfully completed the first three years of my Bachelors Degree in Communication and Multimedia Design at Hanze UAS, with a major in Game Design and a minor in Medialism. I completed an internship as a Game Designer at Dutch publishing studio Indietopia, giving me valuable industry experience and preparing me for the final year of my degree program. With this experience, I planned to enter the games industry after graduating in the summer of 2023.</p>

        <h4>2023</h4>
        <p>I graduated and successfully completed my Bachelor of Science in Communication and Multimedia Design at Hanze UAS, with a major in Game Design and a minor in Medialism. During the final year of my studies I was hired as a Junior Developer by Dutch publishing studio Indietopia. While working at Indietopia I functioned as the lead designer and developer on multiple commercial Unreal Engine projects focused in the Dutch cultural sector, while also coaching several groups of interns at a post-secondary level and guiding them in day to day work.</p>

        <h3 class="w3-text-cyan">An Evolving Industry</h3>
        <h4>2024</h4>
        <p>After almost two years of work at Indietopia, I was affected by layoffs that many other game industry professionals have faced during a period of instability in the industry. During this time I focused on developing two games in Unreal Engine 5, one individually and one with a small multidisciplinary team. I have been seeking a mentor while I focus on improving my skills and continuing professional development to prepare for my next career opportunity in the games industry. I am actively searching for <b>Junior Game Designer</b> and <b>Junior Technical Game Designer</b> roles based in Canada and the European Union.</p>

        <h3 class="w3-text-cyan">Current Life</h3>
        <h4>2025 and Beyond</h4>
        <p>While searching for my next opportunity in the industry I co-founded <a href="https://olivebranchinteractive.net/" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;" class="w3-hover-text-blue-grey">Olive Branch Interactive</a> in The Netherlands with several of my peers from Hanze UAS, an indie studio currently building the next generation of virtual tabletop software for playing Dungeons and Dragons. After much deliberation, I also decided to move back home to Canada while continuing my work and founded a second indie studio. <a href="https://justinkrogman.com/studiokrogman" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;" class="w3-hover-text-blue-grey">Studio Krogman</a> aims to create innovative games and interactive experiences that connect cultural institutions with their audiences through cutting-edge technology.</p>
